- 👋 Hi, I’m @AJmints
- 👀 I’m interested in: Coding and everything that comes along with it. I initially became interested due to block chain technology during the crypto hype, but as I went further down the rabbit hole, I realized that I was very ignorant to what I was interested in. Now my journey has started with being accepted into Launch Code and learning how computer programming works. I am learning JavaScript, HTML, and CSS in the course currently. In my free time I am learning about Bash. Additionally, I am learning more about block chain through learning Solidity and Haskell.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bash, Solidity, and Haskell
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: I don't have an answer to this yet since I am still new and just now learning to use GitHub. In time, I will update this.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can reach me via Email at AlexJmints@gmail.com
